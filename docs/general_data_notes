##VARIANT TYPES AND POSITIONS

##all_snps_positions.txt
This is a count of each position category in the dbSNP database, generated from the snp151.txt file (not provided as it is very large) 

##all_snps_types.txt 
As above

##over5...
as above, but for the subset with a frequency of over 5%

To make the full file (snp151) run, it was split into many files, and the following was run: 
find ./split_snp_no_alts/* | parallel -j20 ./counting_split_snp_muttypes.sh

otherwise processing_summaries.sh was used


##MISC

##benign_snps_with_alternate
The benign database with the processed alternate chromosome (Making_alt_allele_column.R)

##masked_over_5_all_snps_no_alts.txt
All snps, excluding the ncVar pathogenic snps +/- 20000 bp 

##non_coding_chromosomes.txt
Needed for plotting the graphs

##over_5_all_snps_no_alts.txt
Every SNP in a non alternate chromosome with a heterozygosity of >0.05


##path_types.txt
the counted types of variants in the ncVar pathogenic dataset



This repository also represents a lot of manual work, if there is something that seems like it doesn't match up, it was likely done by hand
